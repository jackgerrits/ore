# Ore
An OpenGL rendering engine.

This is an in progress port of the engine used in my [other project](https://github.com/jackgerrits/opengl-car-game) to a generic reusable engine.

## Usage
To use this in a project run the following:
```
cmake . && make
```
This produces a shared library, this must be linked as well the headers included. More detailed instructions will be added.
