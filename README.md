This is an in progress port of the engine used in my [other project](https://github.com/jackgerrits/opengl-car-game) to a generic reusable engine.

## Dependencies
The easiest way to obtain dependencies is your favorite package manager or vcpkg.
```
vcpkg install freeglut glew opengl glm
```

## Build
```
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
```
